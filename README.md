# Inventory Management System

This project implements an Inventory Management System using object-oriented programming principles in Python. It consists of two classes: `Product` and `Inventory`.

## Product Class

The `Product` class represents a product in the inventory and has the following properties:
- Name: The name of the product.
- Price: The price of the product.
- Quantity: The quantity of the product available in the inventory.

The `Product` class also provides methods to get and set the property values.

## Inventory Class

The `Inventory` class maintains a list of `Product` objects and provides methods to manage the inventory:
- Add Product: Adds a new product to the inventory.
- Delete Product: Removes a product from the inventory.
- Edit Product: Modifies the properties of a product in the inventory.
- Get Product: Retrieves information about a specific product in the inventory.
- Get All Products: Returns a list of all products in the inventory.
